### What is this repository for? ###

* Keep a PYTHON library of standard data structures and algorithms
	- to support learning in CS courses
	- to provide performant functionality for future projects


* Graph visualization
	- produce graphs of many types
	- perform algorithm procedures on them to understand the graphs and the algorithms


### Implementations of CLRS data structures and algorithms ###
Implemented so far:
- Disjoint Sets
- Depth-first-search (DFS)
- Prim minimum spanning tree (MST)
- Kruskal MST
- Dijkstra single source shortest paths
- Bellman-Ford single source shortest paths
